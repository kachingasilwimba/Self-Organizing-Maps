# Self Organizing Map (SOM)

Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a type of Artificial Neural Network that is used for clustering and dimensionality reduction. It is also known as Kohonen Map, after its inventor Teuvo Kohonen. SOM is an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the underlying structure of the input data, and maps it to a lower-dimensional space, while preserving the topology of the input space.

This repository contains the application of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm in Python using climate model simulation data.
